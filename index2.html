			<h2>Lesson 5. HTML and CSSüëª</h2>

			also add javascript. But first, you need to learn on how you want to create your website the way you want it to be, and that is wireframe. Wireframe is the simplified representations of user-interface or webpage. 
			It focuses on structural layout and functionality rather than visual desiign. </p>
