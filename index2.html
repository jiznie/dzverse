			<p> This lesson taught me that information disseminate utterly the same when information is processed in a human brain.
				But in computers, data is first viewed by a computer before proceeding in showing the user the information that can be 
				understood by the user. From inputing the data, to processing, and storing it inside to save the information for a subsequent
				use in future, to sending information to people in a usable format.</p>

			<h2>Lesson 5. HTML and CSSüëª</h2>
			<img src="html.jpg" alt="lesson 1 image">
			<p> I learned html tags and saw hell at the same time. Html tags are learned to create a website. From the basics, to styling it using css, and if you want to add animation, you can
			also add javascript. But first, you need to learn on how you want to create your website the way you want it to be, and that is wireframe. Wireframe is the simplified representations of user-interface or webpage. 
			It focuses on structural layout and functionality rather than visual desiign. </p>
